# mementodiebus

## What is this project?
Memento diebus is a product for daily reflection of the day. The name cames from "memento mori", which means do not forget the death. My message through this product is that we need to keep reflecting our daily schedule, and activity.

## Who will favor this product.
Only for me, I think. I have written something quite "woke", but honestly I am not good at making diary, even though it is written through my voice. I wish I could use my brainwave for writing my daiary... In this case, it is difficult to write both daily explanation(like what we did) and our emotion or takeaways(like what we though or what we felt). So, this apps works below.
- import information from google calendar or apple calendar about our schedules.
- You will receive a notification recounting what happened yesterday.
- user will reflect according to imported calendar information.
- The system displays the user's calendar entries.
- The user looks at his or her calendar for yesterday and enters whether or not he or she was able to keep to schedule and what, if any, changes were made.
- The interface is similar to Google Calendar. The user enters the daily flow of events as if checking off a checklist. If there is a change in the schedule, the schedule after the change is written, similar to the input method of the Google Calendar.
- The system has three input fields: a section for yesterday's information, weather information based on your feelings, and special notes. 
The system releases a weekly report once a week using LLM.
